### Accessing Form Data with flask.request.form
-  One can use flask.request.form to access form data that a user has submitted via a POST request. For instance, this feature can be used if you have a login form with username and password fields.

In your HTML file, you might have a form like this:
```html
<form method="POST" action="/login">
    <input type="text" name="username">
    <input type="password" name="password">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
The Python code to access the username and password will be as follows:
```python
from flask import request, Flask
app = Flask("__name__")
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    # process login here
```
